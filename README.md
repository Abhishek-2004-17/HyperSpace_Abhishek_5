# HyperSpace

A platform for connecting clients with rented warehouses for AI-driven product management and hyperlocal deliveries.

This project is split into two parts:
1. **Backend** (located at `HyperSpace/Backend1`)  
2. **Frontend** (located at `HyperSpace/Frontend`)

Below is a brief overview, setup steps, file structure, and references to help you get the application running quicklyâ€”especially useful for hackathons.
